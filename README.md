## CJK_REACT_Weather_App

### Building my own weather app using Tommorrow.io api

### <u>Note</u>

- For this to work on your machine you will need to:
- create a .env file in the root directory
- sign up to tommorrow.io and get an api key
- add the api key to the .env file as REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key

### <u>Next steps:</u>

- Style the hour by hour weather as a carousel
- Make it responsive to work with mobile
- Add Geolocation to get weather based on current location
- Add pollen data to detailWeatherCard and hourlyWeatherCard
- Make background image change to suit weather
- Add a method for users to upload their own weather image for use on the app
- Investigate methods for advertising:
  - links to flights/accommodation to the city being searched
  - links to relevant shopping - based on weather at location
  - links to things to do in the location searched

Refactor this Readme.md file so it is inline with this project https://github.com/ChrisKnowles53/CJK_TipCalc_Frontend_Mentor
